- Version 2.0.15
	* Use a pcap callback handler when trace_read_packet() reads from
	  a live pcap source. This gives us better diagnostics, such as 
	  being able to tell if an error occured. Also fixed a bug under
	  FreeBSD where pcap would block until a buffer was full, then
	  would let pcap_next iterate over all of them.

- Version 2.0.14
	* Added support for pcap decoding of PPP interfaces (DLT_LINUX_SLL)
	  This DLT provides a direction bit, which we make use of in 
	  trace_get_direction(). Check the docs for the specifics
	* Fixed a bug where ERF traces weren't being checked for rxerrors.
	  If the ERF record indicates an rxerror, then get_link() returns 
	  NULL.
	* Removed an extra , which was preventing compilation under gcc 3.4
	  in FreeBSD

- Version 2.0.13
	* Improved source docs / doxygen
	* Added functions to retrieve TCP, UDP and ICMP headers encapsulated
	  within the IP sublayer
	  * get_tcp_from_ip()
	  * get_udp_from_ip()
	  * get_icmp_from_ip()
	* Added trace_get_next_option to parse TCP/IP options within a
	  libtrace_packet object
	

- Version 2.0.12
	* check for IP Fragmentation - if so, don't return TCP header on a
	  fragmented packet

- Version 2.0.11 

 	* Added in a fallback function for strndup under freebsd. 
	  Thanks to mjl for this code.

- Version 2.0.10
 	* Removed some badly licensed code.

- Version 2.0.9
	* Added improved conditional codepaths for
		* PCAP 
		* ZLIB
		* BPF
		* DAG
	  - These sections of code are only compiled in if there is
	    appropriate support for them in the OS / asked by configure.
	    In the event of no zlib support, we use a fread interface for 
	    uncompressed trace files instead.

- Version 2.0.8
	* Added better configure time checking for pcap-bpf.h (ie, actually fail early if it can't find it or an equivalent)
	* Added trace_set_direction , to set the direction bit in an ERF based trace.
	* Added trace_truncate_packet, to truncate the packet at a specified length


- Version 2.0.7
	* Assorted bugfixes.

- Version 2.0.3 
	* Fixed packet->size bug for pcap

- Version 2.0.2
	* Port to AMD64. Should also work on IA64
	* Will compile cleanly under gcc-2.95 (Debian Woody)
	* Compiles cleanly under FBSD 4.5 and 5.2. 

- Version 2.0.1
	* Port to FreeBSD. Thanks to Phil Murray for testing this

- Version 2.0.0
	* Major API change for cleanup purposes.
		* libtrace_packet_t object used to hold reference to the
		  trace object, the buffer, and assorted variables
	* First autoconf release
	
- Version 1.1.0
	* Tagged as REL_1_1_0
	* First final release tag
