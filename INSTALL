Installing libtrace:

----------------------------------
To make and install libtrace:

tar zxvf libtrace-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd libtrace-x.y.z/lib
make
(as root)
make install


You may need to run 'ldconfig' as root.

----------------------------------
To build the docs:

cd libtrace-x.y.z
doxygen


This will build the docs into libtrace-x.y.z/docs/{html,man}
There is currently no install candidate for these - sorry about that.


----------------------------------
Using libtrace:

There are a number of example programs which should cover the basics of what you need within libtrace-x.y.z/examples/.



----------------------------------
Large trace files:

Note that if you wish to use libtrace to read in large ( > 2/4 GB) files, and
you wish to use gz-compressed traces or pcap traces, you will need to link
against a version of libz or libpcap that supports large files.

The versions of libz and libpcap that ship with Debian Woody don't support
large file offsets.


To get around this, you have a number of options:

* Don't use compressed files.
* Use stdin as the target of the input uri, and use cat or zcat to pipe the 
  file into stdin, eg:
  zcat largetrace.erf.gz | program -i erf:-
* Use process substitution in place of a filename, eg:
  program -i erf:<(zcat largetrace.erf.gz)


----------------------------------
Currently support input URIs:

ERF (dag card tracefile):
erf:/path/to/file
erf:/path/to/file.gz
erf:/path/to/socket
erf:-

PCAP (from libpcap)
pcap:/path/to/file
pcap:-

PCAP Interface (from libpcap)
pcapint:eth0
pcapint:ppp0

WAG tracefile
wag:/path/to/file
wag:/path/to/file.gz
wag:/path/to/socket
wag:-

WAG card
wagint:/dev/wag0

Real Time Client interface at Waikato University
rtclient:hostname
rtclient:hostname:port

We don't currently support
DAG (native dag)
dag:/dev/dag0
