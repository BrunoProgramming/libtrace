Requirements:
 * >=automake-1.9
 * >=libpcap-0.8
 
Installing libtrace:

./configure
make


You may need to add the line '/usr/local/lib' to your /etc/ld.so.conf and
run 'ldconfig' as root.

----------------------------------
Using libtrace:

There are a number of example programs which should cover the basics of what you need within libtrace-x.y.z/examples/.

----------------------------------
Large trace files:

The versions of libpcap that ship with Debian Woody don't support
large file offsets.


To get around this, you have a number of options:

* Don't use compressed files.
* Use stdin as the target of the input uri, and use cat or zcat to pipe the 
  file into stdin, eg:
  zcat largetrace.pcap.gz | program -i pcap:-
* Use process substitution in place of a filename, eg:
  program -i pcap:<(zcat largetrace.pcap.gz)
