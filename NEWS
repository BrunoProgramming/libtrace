 Added native DAG read support.
 Added conditional code paths for DAG, ZLIB, PCAP, and BPF. If configure doesn't 
 detect the required components for these paths, it will build without them. Attempting to use libtrace with a non-existant code path will generate a warning on stderr and a 
 failure in the requested function

 Autoconf has been implemented, and this has been used to help rebuild under 
FreeBSD. At the same time, a major api change ( relatively small amount of work
involved, but a fundamental change in the api nonetheless) occured, so we've
bumped the version to 2 already.
